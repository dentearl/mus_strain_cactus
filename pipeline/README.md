Analysis pipeline
=================

The Makefile here can be used to run the <code>gene-check</code> and filtering pipeline.

Place executable filters in <code>filters/</code>. Note that filters must not have extensions (i.e. name your filter <code>demo_filter</code>, not <code>demo_filter.py</code>.

# Description of labels
## Initial labels
These labels are applied by `gene-check`.
* **noStart** -- The transcript does not start with `ATG`.
* **noStop** -- The transcript does not end (in-frame) with a recognized stop codon, i.e. `TAA` or `TAG` or `TGA`.
* **badFrame** --
* **frameMismatch** --
* **noCDS** --
* **cdsGap** --
* **cdsMult3Gap** --
* **utrGap** --
* **cdsUnknownSplice** --
* **cdsNonCanonSplice** --
* **utrUnknownSplice** --
* **utrNonCanonSplice** --


## Additional labels
These labels are applied by this pipeline.
* **alignmentPartialMap** -- Applied to `noStop` and `noStart` labels, . Applied by the `shortScaffold_noStartStop` filter.
* **alignmentAbutsEdge** -- Applied to `noStop` and `noStart` labels, . Applied by the `shortScaffold_noStartStop` filter.
* **containsNs** -- Checks the sequence to see if any `N` characters are present anywhere within the transcript. Applied by the `nLook` filter.
* **hasOkCopy** -- . Applied by the `paralogs` filter.
* **hasBadCopy** -- . Applied by the `paralogs` filter.
* **^** -- A leading `^` character to any label means that the transcript contains the same label when evaluated in the originating genome. I.e. when `gene-check` is run on mm10 using the wgEncodeGencodeCompVM2 annotations this same label is applied to that transcript, indicating that the label was not created by the assembly, alignment or trans map processes. Applied by the `gigo` filter.
* **outOfFrameStop** -- Applied to `noStop` labels, checks the last three bases of the transcript (regardless of frame) and checks to see if it is a recognized stop codon, i.e. `TAA`, `TAG` or `TGA`, if they are then this label is applied.
* **\*** -- A wildcard charater, `*` indicates there are other labels that follow. Generated by the `src/geneCheckStats.py` tool.
