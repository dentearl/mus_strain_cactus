# From Benedict:
For those with access to CBSE machines, the 10-way maf is in:

/hive/users/benedict/mouseHub/all.hal
The maf is:

/hive/users/benedict/mouseHub/all.maf

This was produced with the command:

hal2mafMP.py --refGenome C57B6J --ucscNames --inMemory --numProc=10 all.hal all.maf

The MP at the end of hal2mafMP.py stands for "Multi-Processor", and is a parallel version of the basic hal2maf command. To extract out just a subregion that might overlap the CFTR (I did this by hand in the browser, do:)

hal2maf --refGenome C57B6J --ucscNames --refSequence 6 --start 3359286 --length 2000000 all.hal cftr.maf

There are lots of options to hal2maf, but --noDupes will remove any duplications and --inMemory might be faster, albeit using more memory.
